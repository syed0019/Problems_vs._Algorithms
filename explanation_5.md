### Problem 5: Autocomplete with Tries

This prolbem relates to the Trie Dictionary in which we need to find all the suffixes in the dicitionary using recursive call.

__Find Method__

Time Complexity: O(n)
As we need to iterate through each character.

Space Complexity: O(1)
No memory is allocated

__Insert Method__

Time Complexity: O(n)
Here, we need to iterate through each character.

Space Complexity: O(n)
In this method, 'n' number of characters need to be allocated therefore, space complexity would be of O(n)

__Suffixes Method__

Time Complexity: O(n)
As we need to iterate through each character.

Space Complexity: O(1)
No memory is allocated.
