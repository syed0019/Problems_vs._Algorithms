#### Problem 4: Dutch National Flag Problem

This problem is tackler as the construction of a output list, issue form a single transverse of the elements. By using, several pointers, it is possible on a single transverse to properly order the provided array.

_Time and Space complexity_

In this case the time complexity is precisely, O(n). Analyzing the space complexity, due to the non usage of auxiliary tables (only a few pointers), it is of order O(1) (excluding the input space).
