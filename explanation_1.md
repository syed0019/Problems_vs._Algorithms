#### Problem 1: Square Root of an Integer

In this problem, I used while-loop to iterate through _imagingery array_ and to take median/mid_num each time and squaring this number to check whether the squared_num is equal, greater or lesser than our target. This resembels the BST (Binary Search Tree) approach therefore time-complexity would be Big-O of O(log(n)). As for the space complexity, it is indepedent of the input and therefore would be big-O of O(1).

- Time complexity: O(log(n))
- Space complexity: O(1)
